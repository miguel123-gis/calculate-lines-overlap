# calculate-routes-overlap
Made a short #PyQGIS script that gets the length of multiple roads in kilometer, calculate the overlap, and gets the percentage of overlap vs the roads compared. Hopefully, we get to use it in work. The outputs are a printed summary in the console and a shapefile of the overlap, now dissolved, with the necessary fields and attributes.
